This code exhibits an uncommon PHP bug related to type juggling and array keys.  When using a non-string value as an array key, PHP will implicitly convert it to a string.  However, the way it converts floating-point numbers to strings can lead to unexpected results and comparisons that evaluate to false even when the numerical values are identical.  Consider this example:

```php
$array = [];
$array[1.1] = 'value1';
$array[1.1000000000000001] = 'value2';

var_dump($array); // This will output two separate entries, not one!
var_dump(array_key_exists(1.1, $array)); // This will be true
var_dump(array_key_exists(1.1000000000000001, $array)); // This will also be true
var_dump($array[1.1] === $array[1.1000000000000001]); // This will be false!
```

This happens because PHP's floating-point to string conversion isn't perfectly consistent, resulting in slightly different string representations for numerically equivalent floating point numbers.  This leads to subtle bugs, especially when comparing array keys or using floating-point numbers as keys in hash-based data structures.
